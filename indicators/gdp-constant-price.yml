  Gross domestic product (GDP) at constant prices refers to the volume level of
  GDP. Constant price estimates of GDP are obtained by expressing values in
  terms of a base period. In theory, the price and quantity components of a
  value are identified and the price in the base period is substituted for that
  in the current period. Two main methods are adopted in practice. The first,
  referred to as "quantity revaluation", is based on a methodology consistent
  with the above theory (i.e., by multiplying the current period quantity by the
  base period price). The second, commonly referred to as "price deflation",
  involves dividing price indexes into the observed values to obtain the volume
  estimate. The price indexes used are built up from the prices of the major
  items contributing to each value.
