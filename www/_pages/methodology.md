In order to get a quick overview of the status of the individual indicators, one of four possible weather symbols is shown in the report for each indicator, if calculable. This label is neither a political evaluation nor a prognosis. Instead, the symbols offer an initial assessment of the development, but do not replace the explanatory texts or further analyses and background information. 

Indicators with absolute or relative target values
In most cases, an indicator should achieve a specific absolute or relative target value in a target year. With such a target formulation, the average of the last five annual changes is first determined on the basis of the last six data points. This value is assumed for future annual development up to the target year. In exceptional cases, the calculation of the average change can be made with four or five data points. If fewer than four usable annual values are available, no calculation is made. Building on this development, a hypothetical target value is determined and compared with the specified target value of the indicator. Based on the resulting difference between the two values, one of the following symbols is assigned to the indicator:

###### Reviews over time
The overview table also shows the ratings of an indicator based on the status of the previous years. This shows whether the weather symbol for an indicator has been stable or rather volatile over the past few years.
